These are the developmental versions of my application before version 1.0

jsTest.html is the first working force graph I created.

jsTest-1.html is the first in the many versions of trying to perfect the force layout
The versions go jsTest-1[0] -> jsTest-1[1] -> jsTest-1[1-1] -> jsTest-1[1-2] -> jsTest-1[2]

Then there were some massive graphs I was working on: jsTest-10k-set.html, jsTest-10k-set[1].html, jsTest-30k-set.html, and jsTest-full-set.html. *Note: I would not run jsTest-full-set.html unless you have a very powerful CPU. 358000 rows of data will freeze up your browser.

Another neat graph I created was a force graph of part of Pennsylvania's road network: jsTest-road-set.html.

jsTestScript.js is the JavaScript functionality of the pre-development version of the application. Then testScript.js, testScript1-1, testScript1, and testScript2 were the steps I took to get to the development version of the JavaScript and D3 logic.

To run any of these incomplete apps, you must have cit-Test-set.tsv in the same directory as the source. The D3 library is linked via the Internet so these pages will not work without an active internet connection. i.e run these through a local server. I use WAMP, but should work with LAMP, XAMPP, etc.
